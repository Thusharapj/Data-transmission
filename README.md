# Data-transmission
 I have selected ESP32 as MCU for the task.
 This code transmits a piece of paragraph from PC to ESP32. ESP32 stores the data and then transmits it back to PC. 
 Data received from ESP32 is printed on the serial monitor of the PC.
 Speed of the data transmission is calculated and is displayed on the serial monitor in bytes per second.
